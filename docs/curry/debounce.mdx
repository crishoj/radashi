title: debounce
description: Delay a function until after a specified time has elapsed since the last call
---

### Usage

Create a new function that delays invoking a callback until after a specified time has elapsed since the last call.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

// Debounce a search function to avoid making API calls on every keystroke
const searchAPI = _.debounce({ delay: 300 }, async query => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/search?q=${query}`)
    const results = await response.json()
    displayResults(results)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Search failed:', error)
  }
})

// Simulate user typing in a search box
document.querySelector('#search-input').addEventListener('input', event => {
  const query = event.target.value
  searchAPI(query)
})

function displayResults(results) {
  // Update UI with search results
  console.log('Search results:', results)
}
```

## Methods

### Flushing

The `flush` method forces a debounced call to execute immediately. If no call was currently scheduled, this method does nothing. So you're effectively saying “execute the function now, but only if it's scheduled to execute.”

```ts
const debouncedFunc = _.debounce({ delay: 1000 }, () => {
  console.log('Flushed')
})

debouncedFunc.flush()
```

### Pending check

The `isPending` method returns `true` if the debounced function is currently waiting to execute.

```ts
const debouncedFunc = _.debounce({ delay: 1000 }, () => {
  console.log('Flushed')
})

debouncedFunc()
debouncedFunc.isPending() // => true
```

### Cancelling

The `cancel` method can be used to cancel a debounced function. Future calls still get debounced, but the currently pending call is immediately cancelled.

```ts
const debouncedFunc = _.debounce({ delay: 1000 }, () => {
  console.log('Flushed')
})

debouncedFunc()
debouncedFunc.cancel()
```
