title: throttle
description: Create a throttled callback function
---

### Usage

Throttle accepts an options object with an `interval` and a source function to call
when invoked. Repeated calls to the returned function will only call the source
function if the `interval` milliseconds of time has passed. Otherwise, it will ignore
the invocation.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const onMouseMove = () => {
  rerender()
}

addEventListener('mousemove', _.throttle({ interval: 200 }, onMouseMove))
```

## Timing

A visual of the throttle behavior when `interval` is `200`. The throttle function
returned by `throttle` can be called every millisecond but it will only call
the given callback after `interval` milliseconds have passed.

```sh
Time: 0ms - - - - 100ms - - - - 200ms - - - - 300ms - - - - 400ms - - - -
Throttle Invocations: x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x - - -
Source Invocations: x - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - -
```

If the `falling` option is set to `true`, the source function will be called again after
`interval` if any invocations were made during the throttled period.

```sh
Time: 0ms - - - - 100ms - - - - 200ms - - - - 300ms - - - - 400ms - - - -
Throttle Invocations: x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Source Invocations: x - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - -
```

### isThrottled

The function returned by `throttle` has a `isThrottled` method that when called will return if there is any active throttle.

```ts
const debounced = _.throttle({ interval: 200 }, onMouseMove)

// ... sometime later

debounced.isThrottled()
```
